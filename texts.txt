Giovanna Fletcher has revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge was easy to 'relate to' and  just like 'any other mum' when they met on her motherhood podcast. 

Kate Middleton, 38, appeared on a special episode of Giovanna's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast, which focused on her early years work and landmark survey ‘5 Big Questions on the Under Fives,' last week. 

Essex-born Giovanna, 35, who has three children, Buzz, five, Buddy, four, and Max, one, with McFly's Tom Fletcher, appeared on Lorraine today where she told that despite being unable to sleep for a week before the interview, she was soon able to relax with the royal. 

'It doesn't matter who you are, what you have, what you do, there are so many problems of motherhood we can all relate to', she explained. 'It's a complete leveller.'

Having met in Birmingham at the launch of 5 Big Questions on the Under Fives, Kate and Giovanna sat down after a joint visit to LEYF Stockwell Gardens Nursery in London.

'The week before, I literally wasn't sleeping and I think because she's been on my wish list for so long, my dream guest', said Giovanna. 

'It's one thing to actually want someone on, but then get them and think, "Oh my god there's so much responsibility".'

However, Giovanna said that planning her episode out as usual was the key to easing her nerves.  

'What I do every time is map it out and plan everything, then don't look at the paper at all and enjoy the chat and just kind of get lost in it,' she said. 

'As soon as I started remembering I was talking to another mum, everything else kind of made sense.' 

She told that Kate, who had been her 'dream guest' from the very first episode of her podcast, because the royal is clearly 'passionate' about her early years work.   

'It doesn't matter who you are, what you have, what you do, there are so many problems of motherhood we can all relate to', said Giovanna. 

'It's a complete leveller. We were talking about that lack of sleep and it just get's you.'  

The Early Years episode discussed the 5 Big Questions on the Under Fives – a quick, online survey which aims to spark a national conversation on the early years that will ultimately help bring about positive, lasting change for generations to come. 

It is designed to bring together the thoughts of as many people as possible – recognising that everyone has a role in ensuring strong, healthy foundations for the youngest in our society that will positively affect their lifelong outcomes.

Speaking of Kate's work for the charity, Giovanna said: 'Its a brilliant time for her, the amount of work she's done on early years. 

'That's the brilliant thing about the podcast, you really understand how much she cares and how passionate she is about the early years.'  

Speaking of the survey in the interview, Kate said: 'I think ultimately if you look at who's caring and looking after and nurturing children in the most vital period from pregnancy all the way to the age of five. 
    
'You know parents and carers are right at the heart of that, and families are right at the heart of that, and although I've spoken to the scientists and the service providers, it's so important to listen to families.' 

During the interview, the royal also told the author and podcast host it was part of her childhood she would like her three children, Prince George , six, Princess Charlotte , four, and Prince Louis , one,  to experience. 

'I had an amazing granny who devoted a lot of time to us, playing with us, doing arts and crafts and going to the greenhouse to do gardening, and cooking with us,' said Kate, in the podcast. 

'And I try and incorporate a lot of the experiences that she gave us at the time into the experiences that I give my children now.'

Kate Middleton's brother James urges people to support his 'wonderful sister' by taking part in her Early Years survey

Kate Middleton's brother James has shared an Instagram message showing his 'huge support' for the 'wonderful' royal and her work. 

The entrepreneur, 32, shared the Instagram post heaping praise on the Duchess of Cambridge, 38, and urging people to take part in her Early Years survey, ‘5 Big Questions on the Under Fives'. 

Alongside a message of support for the Kate's recent work, James shared a snap from his childhood with his grandparent's British Bulldog Gibson. 

While promoting the survey on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast last week, the Duchess opened up about her 'happy childhood' alongside brother James.  

James, who regularly uses his Instagram page to share photographs of himself alongside his nine dogs, urged his followers to take part in the survey earlier today.  

Sharing the post with his 165,000 followers, James wrote: 'This isn’t a post about dogs. Brace yourselves....BUT it’s in huge support of my wonderful sister’s ‘Early Years’ initiative to ask “5 big questions on the under fives".'

He went on: 'If you have 5 minutes and live in the UK, join the biggest conversation on early childhood. 

'Like me even if you don’t have children, your own experiences will help invest in the future of the next generation.' 

He added that there was a link in his profile to the survey. 

Kate's parents Carole, 65, and Michael, 70, also shared a link to her survey on their businesses' Instagram page. 

Posting on the Party Pieces Instagram stories, they linked to a recent video clip of the Duchess calling for more responses to her early years survey.

Like James, they urged followers to click on a link to the survey in their profile. 

The Five Big questions On The Under-Fives attracted over 200,000 responses after it was launched in January.

The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Kate's Royal Foundation, is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the data will guide the duchess' future work.

The Duchess spoke at length about her survey while appearing on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast this week, saying the project has been 'quite a journey' and that she's 'excited to talk about it a bit more publicly.'

During the conversation the Duchess opened up about her childhood in a deeply intimate conversation with Giovanna, who has also written about being a mother to three children with her husband Tom Fletcher, a member of the band McFly. 

She praised her parents Carole and Michael for their 'huge dedication' to her and her two siblings, James and Pippa, 36.   

During the podcast, the 38-year-old said: 'I had a very happy childhood. It was great fun and I'm very lucky I come from a very strong family. My parents were hugely dedicated.

'I really appreciate now as a parent how much they sacrificed for us. They came to every sports match, they'd be the ones on the side line shouting, and we'd always have our family holidays together.'

Reflection on how she was raised, and how this has impacted the way she wants to parent, the Duchess said it was the small things which she remembers the most.

She said: 'But what resonates the most is the simple things. I see that now with my own children. Life now is so busy and distracting and sometimes simple things like watching a fire on a really rainy day provides such enjoyment.' 

The podcast focused on her early years work and landmark survey ‘5 Big Questions on the Under Fives'.

Kate Middleton's deeply personal podcast admissions were 'not a vanity exercise' and the royal is 'exposing herself' with her Early Years work, a source tells People magazine

Kate Middleton's deeply personal conversations on a recent podcast were 'not a vanity exercise' but part of her work as a 'credible' voice in the Early Year's space, a source has revealed. 

The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, shared her anxieties and spoke of worrying about falling short in her parenting to Prince George, 6, Princess Charlotte, 4, and Prince Louis, 1 on, Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast last week. 

But now a palace source has revealed that Kate has been 'exposing' a major part of her normally private life in the intimate conversations.

They said she was motivated by her passion for childhood development, telling People magazine: 'This is her talking about her work, and what she has learned as a mother because of her work.'  

The duchess opened up in the deeply intimate conversation with Giovanna, who has also written about being a mother to three children with her husband Tom Fletcher, a member of the band McFly.

The source said the move by the Duchess involved her baring a major - normally private - part of herself and opening up about her life as a mother. 

During the podcast, the 38-year-old described herself as a 'hands-on-mum', but believes any mother who does not admit to feeling like a failure from time to time is 'lying'.

And she also praised her parents Carole, 65, and Michael, 70, for their 'huge dedication' in raising her and her two siblings, Pippa, 36, and James, 32. 

She spoke of her dismay at how royal duties sometimes force her to abandon parenting tasks such as doing the school run - and joked that her children berate her it.  

The podcast focused on her early years work and landmark survey ‘5 Big Questions on the Under Fives'.

This comes days after royal expert Omid Scobie revealed how Kate had 'quietly picked up steam' with the project. 

Earlier this week, Omid said the Duchess had 'really stepped out into a more confident role' in The Firm in recent months as she launched her Early Years work which will be a 'lifelong project' for the royal.

Speaking on the Heirpod podcast, he said Kate's voice was getting 'louder and louder as she gains more confidence' in her position within the royal family.

He said: 'I think there had been times where it felt like she wasn't doing a lot...and we're now at a point where I think she's really realising the impact that she can have when using her platform wisely.'

Coronavirus kills two in Italy as Lombardy is put on lockdown, health minister warns 'you can get it from anybody' and the residents of TWELVE towns are told to stay indoors as virus spreads through Unilever workers

Two coronavirus patients in Italy have today died from the Covid-19 disease that has now killed 2,253 people and infected more than 77,268 across the world. 

The two deaths have triggered a lockdown of twelve towns in the north eastern region of Lombardy and 50,000 people have been asked to stay indoors. 

The first to die, a 78-year-old father-of-three, passed away in a hospital in Padua on Friday evening.

Adriano Trevisan, a retired bricklayer, had been admitted to the hospital for another health issue ten days ago said local authorities.

The second patient to die was an elderly woman whose death has triggered the closing down of shops, offices and community centres in Casalpusterlengo, according to Italian news agency Ansa.  

The mayor of Milan, the business capital of Italy, shut down public offices.

Hundreds of residents and workers who came into contact with an estimated 54 people confirmed infected in Italy were in isolation pending test results. 

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expressed his sympathies for the two deaths and said he had called an emergency meeting, as more than 50,000 people from about a dozen towns in two northern regions were asked to stay at home by the local authorities.  

The few people out on the streets were wearing coveted face masks, which were nearly impossible to find in sold-out pharmacies.

The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, said there were 39 confirmed cases in the region, where 10 towns received orders to suspend non-essential activities and services.

An elderly woman who died tested positive for the virus, though it wasn't clear if that is what caused her death. 

Health Minister Luca Zaia said Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any other flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source of infection or one with direct links to China is no longer effective.

'You can get it from anyone,' he told reporters. 

'We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact' with suspected carriers. 

While the virus isn't particularly lethal, it can be for the elderly or people with existing conditions, he said. 

Mr Trevisan's daughter, Vanessa, had been Mayor of Vo' Euganeo, a small town of 3,300 inhabitants which is now under lockdown. 

Hundreds of people who came into contact with the roughly 25 people infected with the disease were in isolation pending test results. Civil protection crews set up a tent camp outside a closed hospital in Veneto to screen medical staff for the virus. 

The first town to be shuttered was Codogno, with a population of 15,000, where three people tested positive for the virus, including a 38-year-old man and his wife, who is eight months pregnant.

The 38-year-old, who works for Unilever in Lodi, is believed to have contracted the virus after meeting a friend who had recently returned from China in a bar. 

He is now reportedly in a stable condition in hospital.  

A football friend of his from his running club, the son of a bar owner in Codogno, has also tested positive, along with three regulars at the bar. 

Three others there have tested positive to a first novel coronavirus test and are awaiting their definitive results. 

The three, all of whom are retired, live in the small town of Castiglione d'Adda. 

Tests are underway on the 38-year-old's doctor, who made a house call on him, as well as on 120 people he worked with in the research and development branch of Unilever in Casalpusterlengo, said Lombardy regional health chief Giulio Gallera. 

Codogno mayor Francesco Passerini said the news of the cases 'has sparked alarm' throughout the town south of Milan.  

Five doctors and 14 other people tested positive for the virus in Lombardy, after apparently frequenting the same bar, with two other cases in Veneto, authorities said at a press conference.

Over 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home in the areas concerned.

Word of the contagion sparked fears throughout the region, particularly given the closure of the emergency room at the Codogno hospital.

'We are old and we are very concerned,' said 76-year-old Codogno resident Carmelo Falcone.

'I live on my own. I really don't know what to do.'

Italian health minister Roberto Speranza said Italy is now seeing the same sort of 'cluster' of cases that Germany and France have seen.

He signed an ordinance with Lombardy's regional president outlining measures to contain the cluster to the 10 towns so far affected: Codogno, Castiglione d'Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Maleo, Fombio, Bertonico, Castelgerundo, Terranova dei Passerini, Somaglia and San Fiorano.

The towns, which have between 1,000-15,000 residents each, are located around 37 miles southeast of Milan, Lombardy's capital and Italy's business centre.

The ordinance suspends public gatherings, commercial and business activity, sport, education, and other recreational activities throughout the region, Mr Speranza, the health minister, said.

He defended the precautionary measures Italy took previously, noting that Italy remains the lone European country to have barred flights to and from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

'We had the highest measures in Europe,' he said. 

Individual cities outside the core cordon area, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions cancelling school after confirming their own cases.

Streets in the towns were deserted, with only a few people seen abroad, and signs showing public spaces closed.

In Casalpusterlengo, where the second patient died, a large electronic message board outside the town hall read 'Coronavirus: the population is invited to remain indoors as a precaution'.

Residents of the northern towns of Codogno and Castiglione d'Adda are being urged to stay at home as medical tests continue.

Some 250 people were being placed in isolation after coming into contact with the new cases, according to the Lombardy region, and 60 worker at Unilever have been tested for the virus. 

The only other fatality in Europe was a Chinese tourist who died last week in France.  

Earlier today, 19 Italians who spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome's military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since February 5.

Following the first health checks and decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola where they will spend a 14-day isolation period. 

In Rome, doctors at the Spallanzani infectious disease hospital reported some good news in the otherwise bleak day: An Italian who tested positive for the virus two weeks ago is to be released, and a sickened Chinese tourist has tested negative for the first time. 

Spallanzani had been caring for these patients for more than two weeks, Italy's only cases until the clusters emerged in the north on Friday. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the number of coronavirus cases with no clear epidemiological link, although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, its director general said on Saturday.

Cases with no clear link include those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter.

According to reports, the disease remained mild in 80 per cent of coronavirus patients, and was severe or critical in 20 per cent of patients, he said. In 2 per cent of reported cases, the virus was fatal.

'Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,' he said. 'We have also published a strategic preparedness and response plan, with a call for $675 million to support countries, especially those which are most vulnerable.'
