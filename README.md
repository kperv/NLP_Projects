 
Exercises with Data Science/ML/Python.
Almost all programms are closely connected to the study book:
A.Muller Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

3D_SVM is a 3D visualisation of decision surface creation by Support Vector Classifier.
Data is blobs (4 random sets). Don't forget to move the runners! 

Cancer_svc: SVC model was applied to Breast cancer dataset. Best model is found by GridSearch. Test set accuracy is 0.96. Then the cross validation is repeated with ROC scoring to get better results. 

ModelSelection_SVC_iris is another exercise on model selection using GridSearch using iris dataset. Heatmap visualisation shows calculated scpre map.

Naughts&Crosses. Python. Do you want to play "naughts and crosses"? Two players, up to 5*5 grid.

NYC_citibike. Time series exercise. Real data of citibike NYC rentals (August, 2018) was analysed. Ridge classifier showed 0.94 score.

PCA_iris is a simple exercise on feature decomposition. 

string_lists is an interactive programm creating a file.lst in the PATH folder (or reading other .lst files if any)
and interactively puts lines given from the user to this file. You can add and delete lines or save changes on every step.
