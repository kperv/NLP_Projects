 
Exercises with Data Science/ML/Python.
======================================

## Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing

* **FoodReviews_MulticlassClassification** A simple 3 layer NN to classify real reviews into 5 classes (1 is abs negative, 5 is abs positive). Bag of words with sparse matrices and a word dictionary.

## Data visualisation

* **3D_SVM** is a 3D visualisation of decision surface creation by Support Vector Classifier.
Data is blobs (4 random sets).

* **BlackFriday** is a gender/age customer analysis of a shop's sales.

* **Titanic_survival** is a simple seaborn visualisation of Titanic passengers survival according to gender, deck and class.

## Scikit learn

* **SVC_breast_cancer** SVC model was applied to Breast cancer dataset. Best model is found by GridSearch. Test set accuracy is 0.96. Then the cross validation is repeated with ROC scoring to get better results. 

* **ModelSelection_SVC_iris** is another exercise on model selection using GridSearch using iris dataset. Heatmap visualisation shows calculated score map.

* **TimeSeries_NYCcitibike** Time series exercise. Real data of citibike NYC rentals (August, 2018) was analysed. Ridge classifier showed 0.94 score.

* **PCA_iris** is a simple exercise on feature decomposition. 

## Python

* **Naughts'n'Crosses** is a python implementation of a game for two players, up to 5*5 grid.

* **Files_with_user_strings** is an interactive programm which creates a _file.lst_ in the PATH folder (or reading other _.lst_ files if any) and interactively writes lines given by a user to this file. You can add and delete lines or save changes on every step.
