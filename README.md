The notebook *TF_3layerNN.ipynb* is a **TensorFlow_1.10** "from-scratch" 3 dense layer neural network to predict digits from **Scikit-learn** dataset.
*TF_logit_regres.ipynb* is a similar back-to-basics notebook to try different cost functions as well as see batch normalization impact on NN training.

*TopicSimilarity.ipynb*, to which texts.txt is a corpus, uses **NLTK** to create topic vectors manually and check their cosine similarity.

Recently uploaded python files contain more advanced NLP projects, where I used **PyTorch** as a framework. Both files use Wine Reviews dataset from kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. The file *wine_CNN_torch.py* is a task of training a **Convolutional Neural Net** to predict a country of a review. *wine_GRU_gen_with_class.py* is an attempt to make a **Natural Language Generator**, which is trained on **GRU** unit with class-awareness.
