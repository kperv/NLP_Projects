## Hi, there! Thanks for coming!

I'm Ksenia, a physicist and a linguist, and here are some of my Natural Language Processing notebooks.
Here you can expect mid-level NLP tasks, nothing extra. 
I mostly use **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit learn**, **NLTK**, **Spacy**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**.

## Now I can teach a computer to group articles on its semantics. Check my TopicSimilarity notebook for details.
