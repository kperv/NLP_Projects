 
Exercises with Data Science/ML/Python.
======================================

## Python / Jupyter notebook / scikit learn

* **3D_SVM** is a 3D visualisation of decision surface creation by Support Vector Classifier.
Data is blobs (4 random sets). Don't forget to move the runners! 

* **Cancer_svc** SVC model was applied to Breast cancer dataset. Best model is found by GridSearch. Test set accuracy is 0.96. Then the cross validation is repeated with ROC scoring to get better results. 

* **ModelSelection_SVC_iris** is another exercise on model selection using GridSearch using iris dataset. Heatmap visualisation shows calculated scpre map.

* **NYC_citibike** Time series exercise. Real data of citibike NYC rentals (August, 2018) was analysed. Ridge classifier showed 0.94 score.

* **PCA_iris** is a simple exercise on feature decomposition. 

* **Naughts&Crosses** is a python implementation of a game for two players, up to 5*5 grid.

* **string_lists** is an interactive programm which creates a _file.lst_ in the PATH folder (or reading other _.lst_ files if any) and interactively writes lines given by a user to this file. You can add and delete lines or save changes on every step.

Almost all notebooks are closely connected to the study book: A.Muller Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
