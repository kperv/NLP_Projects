1. entitity_recognition.py is my idea to approach the tast without Transformers, using only Word Vector similarity and SpaCy.
2. TopicSimilarity notebook is a document similarity comparison. The documents to be compared are texts.txt, manually collected. Every document is processed, transformed in tf-idf vector. cosine similarity is used to get the resulting value.
